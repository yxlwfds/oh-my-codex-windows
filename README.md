**Community:** [Discord](https://discord.gg/PUwSMR9XNk) — shared OMX/community server for oh-my-codex and related tooling.

OMX is a workflow layer for [OpenAI Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex).

<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>🚨 CAUTION — RECOMMENDED DEFAULT ONLY: macOS or Linux with Codex CLI.</strong><br><br><strong>OMX is primarily designed and actively tuned for that path.</strong><br><strong>Native Windows and Codex App are not the default experience, may break or behave inconsistently, and currently receive less support.</strong></td>
</tr>

It keeps Codex as the execution engine and makes it easier to:
- start a stronger Codex session by default
- run one consistent workflow from clarification to completion
- invoke the canonical skills with `$deep-interview`, `$ralplan`, `$team`, and `$ralph`
- keep project guidance, plans, logs, and state in `.omx/`

## Recommended default flow

If you want the default OMX experience, start here:

```bash
npm install -g @openai/codex oh-my-codex
owx --madmax --high
```

On a real `oh-my-codex` version bump, the global npm install now prints an explicit reminder instead of launching `owx setup` automatically. When you're ready, run `owx setup` manually or use the manual `owx update` command to check npm and then run the same setup refresh path.

**Codex plugin install note:** this repo also ships an official Codex plugin layout at `plugins/oh-my-codex` with marketplace metadata in `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`. That plugin bundles the mirrored skill surface plus plugin-scoped companion metadata for optional MCP compatibility servers and apps, disabled by default. Native/runtime hooks still stay on the setup/runtime side rather than the installable plugin manifest. It is still **not** a replacement for `npm install -g oh-my-codex` plus `owx setup`: legacy setup mode installs native agents and prompts, while plugin setup mode relies on plugin discovery for bundled skills and archives/removes legacy OMX-managed prompts/native-agent TOMLs so stale role files cannot shadow plugin behavior.

Then work normally inside Codex:

```text
$deep-interview "clarify the authentication change"
$ralplan "approve the auth plan and review tradeoffs"
$ralph "carry the approved plan to completion"
$team 3:executor "execute the approved plan in parallel"
$ultragoal "turn this launch into durable Codex goals"
```

That is the main path.
Before you treat the runtime as ready, run the quick-start smoke test below: `owx doctor` verifies the install shape, while `owx exec` proves the active Codex runtime can actually authenticate and complete a model call from the current environment.
Start OMX strongly, clarify first when needed, approve the plan, then choose `$team` for coordinated parallel execution or `$ralph` for the persistent completion loop.

## What OMX is for

Use OMX if you already like Codex and want a better day-to-day runtime around it:
- a standard workflow built around `$deep-interview`, `$ralplan`, `$team`, and `$ralph`
- durable multi-goal handoffs with `$ultragoal` and `.omx/ultragoal` artifacts when a launch needs sequential Codex goals
- specialist roles and supporting skills when the task needs them
- project guidance through scoped `AGENTS.md`
- durable state under `.omx/` for plans, logs, memory, and mode tracking

If you want plain Codex with no extra workflow layer, you probably do not need OMX.

## Quick start

### Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- Codex CLI installed: `npm install -g @openai/codex`
- Codex auth configured and visible in the same shell/profile that will run OMX
- `tmux` on macOS/Linux if you want the recommended durable team runtime
- `psmux` on native Windows only if you intentionally want the less-supported Windows team path

### A good first session

After install, check both boundaries:

```bash
owx doctor
codex login status
owx exec --skip-git-repo-check -C . "Reply with exactly OMX-EXEC-OK"
```

`owx doctor` catches missing OMX files, hooks, and runtime prerequisites. The real smoke test catches auth, profile, and provider/base-URL problems that only appear when Codex performs an actual request.

Launch OMX the recommended way:

```bash
owx --madmax --high
```

On macOS/Linux interactive terminals with `tmux` available, this starts the
leader in OMX-managed detached tmux by default so the HUD/runtime panes can be
created and recovered.

If you want a one-off launch with no OMX tmux/HUD management, use `--direct`:

```bash
owx --direct --yolo
```

For a persistent shell/profile preference, set an environment policy:

```bash
OMX_LAUNCH_POLICY=direct owx --yolo
```

Return to the auto/default behavior with:

```bash
unset OMX_LAUNCH_POLICY
```

CLI policy flags win over the environment, and the last CLI policy flag before
`--` wins:

```bash
OMX_LAUNCH_POLICY=direct owx --tmux --yolo
```

Use `OMX_LAUNCH_POLICY=direct|tmux|detached-tmux|auto`. This iteration only
adds CLI and environment controls; it intentionally does not add a config-file
setting. If you run `--direct` from inside an existing tmux pane, OMX will not
create HUD splits, enable mouse mode, or wrap extended-key handling, but the
process still runs inside that already-open terminal pane.

Then try the canonical workflow:

```text
$deep-interview "clarify the authentication change"
$ralplan "approve the safest implementation path"
$ralph "carry the approved plan to completion"
$team 3:executor "execute the approved plan in parallel"
```

Use `$team` when the approved plan needs coordinated parallel work, or `$ralph` when one persistent owner should keep pushing to completion.

## A simple mental model

OMX does **not** replace Codex.

It adds a better working layer around it:
- **Codex** does the actual agent work
- **OMX role keywords** make useful roles reusable
- **OMX skills** make common workflows reusable
- **`.omx/`** stores plans, logs, memory, and runtime state

Most users should think of OMX as **better task routing + better workflow + better runtime**, not as a command surface to operate manually all day.

## Start here if you are new

1. Install or update OMX with `npm install -g @openai/codex oh-my-codex`
2. After install or real OMX version bumps, run `owx setup` yourself when you're ready, or use the manual `owx update` command when you want npm to check for and install the latest build before refreshing setup
3. Run `owx doctor`
4. Run a real execution smoke test: `codex login status` and `owx exec --skip-git-repo-check -C . "Reply with exactly OMX-EXEC-OK"`
5. Launch with `owx --madmax --high`
6. Use `$deep-interview "..."` when the request or boundaries are still unclear
7. Use `$ralplan "..."` to approve the plan and review tradeoffs
8. Choose `$team` for coordinated parallel execution or `$ralph` for persistent completion loops

## Recommended workflow

1. `$deep-interview` — clarify scope when the request or boundaries are still vague.
2. `$ralplan` — turn that clarified scope into an approved architecture and implementation plan.
3. `$team` or `$ralph` — use `$team` for coordinated parallel execution, or `$ralph` when you want a persistent completion loop with one owner.

## Common in-session surfaces

| Surface | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| `$deep-interview "..."` | clarifying intent, boundaries, and non-goals |
| `$ralplan "..."` | approving the implementation plan and tradeoffs |
| `$ralph "..."` | persistent completion and verification loops |
| `$team "..."` | coordinated parallel execution when the work is big enough |
| `/skills` | browsing installed skills and supporting helpers |

## Advanced / operator surfaces

These are useful, but they are not the main onboarding path.

### Team runtime

Use the team runtime when you specifically need durable tmux/worktree coordination, not as the default way to begin using OMX. In Codex App or plain outside-tmux sessions, treat `owx team` as a tmux-runtime shell surface rather than a directly available in-app workflow; launch OMX CLI from shell first if you actually want team execution.

```bash
owx team 3:executor "fix the failing tests with verification"
owx team status <team-name>
owx team resume <team-name>
owx team shutdown <team-name>
```

### Setup, doctor, and HUD

These are operator/support surfaces:
- Codex plugin marketplace install/discovery can cache the plugin under `${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}/plugins/cache/$MARKETPLACE_NAME/oh-my-codex/$VERSION/` (local installs may use `local` as the version identifier); that packaged plugin includes plugin-scoped companion metadata for optional MCP compatibility servers and apps (disabled by default), while native/runtime hooks remain setup-owned, so it is still not the full OMX runtime setup
- `owx setup` installs prompts, skills, AGENTS scaffolding, `.codex/config.toml`, and OMX-managed native Codex hooks in `.codex/hooks.json`
  - setup refresh preserves non-OMX hook entries in `.codex/hooks.json` and only rewrites OMX-managed wrappers
  - `owx setup --merge-agents` preserves existing `AGENTS.md` guidance while inserting or refreshing generated OMX sections between `<!-- OMX:AGENTS:START -->` / `<!-- OMX:AGENTS:END -->`; without `--merge-agents` or `--force`, non-interactive setup keeps skipping existing `AGENTS.md` files
  - `owx uninstall` removes OMX-managed wrappers from `.codex/hooks.json` but keeps the file when user hooks remain
- `owx update` is the manual update command: it checks npm immediately, installs the newest global OMX build, then reruns the same interactive setup refresh path
- fresh OMX-managed `gpt-5.5` config seeding now recommends `model_context_window = 250000` and `model_auto_compact_token_limit = 200000`, but only when those keys are missing
- `.omx-config.json` model/env routing is documented in [the model/env routing reference](./docs/reference/omx-config-schema-routing.md); only edit keys supported by your installed OMX version
- `owx doctor` verifies the install when something seems wrong; it does not prove that the active Codex profile can make an authenticated model call
- `owx hud --watch` is a monitoring/status surface, not the primary user workflow

For non-team sessions, native Codex hooks are now the canonical lifecycle surface:
- `.codex/hooks.json` = native Codex hook registrations
- `.omx/hooks/*.mjs` = OMX plugin hooks
- `owx tmux-hook` / notify-hook / derived watcher = tmux + runtime fallback paths

See [Codex native hook mapping](./docs/codex-native-hooks.md) for the current native / fallback matrix.


### Troubleshooting false-green readiness

A green `owx doctor` means the install and local runtime wiring look sane. If real execution still fails, check the environment Codex actually uses:

- Run `codex login status` and `owx exec --skip-git-repo-check -C . "Reply with exactly OMX-EXEC-OK"` from the same shell/profile that will launch OMX.
- In custom HOME, profile, container, or service shells, confirm the active `~/.codex` (or `CODEX_HOME`) is the one with the expected auth and config. Do not assume your normal user `~/.codex` is visible there.
- If you depend on a local OpenAI-compatible proxy, confirm the active `~/.codex/config.toml` includes the expected `openai_base_url`; otherwise a proxy-issued key can be sent to the default endpoint and fail with `401 Unauthorized`, `Missing bearer or basic authentication in header`, or `Incorrect API key provided`.
- If `owx doctor --team` or resume reports a stale team such as `resume_blocker` or a missing tmux session, clean the dead runtime state before retrying:

```bash
owx team shutdown <team-name> --force --confirm-issues
owx cancel
owx doctor --team
```

Only use the forced team shutdown for a team you have confirmed is dead or intentionally abandoned.

If `Shift+Enter` still submits instead of inserting a newline inside an OMX-managed tmux session, see [Troubleshooting execution readiness](./docs/troubleshooting.md#shiftenter-submits-instead-of-inserting-a-newline-in-tmux-backed-omx-sessions). Current OMX already enables tmux extended-key forwarding around its own Codex launch paths, so a persistent failure is usually a tmux terminal-capability/discoverability problem rather than a net-new OMX feature gap.

### Explore and sparkshell

- `owx explore --prompt "..."` is for read-only repository lookup
- `owx sparkshell <command>` is for shell-native inspection and bounded verification
- when `omx_wiki/` exists, `owx explore` can inject wiki-first context before falling back to broader repository search
- fallback boundaries are explicit: sparkshell-backend fallback is reported on stderr, and spark-model fallback emits stderr metadata plus an `## OMX Explore fallback` notice in stdout so users can see when cost/behavior may differ from the low-cost path

Examples:

```bash
owx explore --prompt "find where team state is written"
owx sparkshell git status
owx sparkshell --tmux-pane %12 --tail-lines 400
```

### Wiki

- `owx wiki` is the CLI-first JSON surface for wiki operations; `omx_wiki` MCP is explicit compatibility only
- wiki data lives as repository project knowledge under `omx_wiki/`
- the wiki is markdown-first and search-first, not vector-first

Examples:

```bash
owx wiki list --json
owx wiki query --input '{"query":"session-start lifecycle"}' --json
owx wiki lint --json
owx wiki refresh --json
```

### Platform notes for team mode

`owx team` works best on macOS/Linux with `tmux`.
Native Windows remains a secondary path, and WSL2 is generally the better choice if you want a Windows-hosted setup.
On native Windows, OMX accepts `psmux` as the tmux-compatible binary for the existing tmux-backed paths it already uses.

| Platform | Install |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | `brew install tmux` |
| Ubuntu/Debian | `sudo apt install tmux` |
| Fedora | `sudo dnf install tmux` |
| Arch | `sudo pacman -S tmux` |
| Windows | `winget install psmux` |
| Windows (WSL2) | `sudo apt install tmux` |

## Known issues

### Intel Mac: high `syspolicyd` / `trustd` CPU during startup

On some Intel Macs, OMX startup — especially with `--madmax --high` — can spike `syspolicyd` / `trustd` CPU usage while macOS Gatekeeper validates many concurrent process launches.

If this happens, try:
- `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine $(which omx)`
- adding your terminal app to the Developer Tools allowlist in macOS Security settings
- using lower concurrency (for example, avoid `--madmax --high`)
