# Ultragoal

`ultragoal` is a durable, repo-native multi-goal workflow layered over Codex goal mode. It keeps the long-range plan in files while Codex goal mode tracks the active thread focus.

## Why this shape

Codex CLI 0.128.0 exposes `goals` as an enabled feature, but `codex --help` has no `goal` shell subcommand. In this runtime, goal mode is exposed to the agent as model tools:

- `get_goal` reads the active thread goal.
- `create_goal` creates one active objective for a thread and fails if the thread already has a goal.
- `update_goal` can only mark the existing goal `complete`.

Upstream Codex goal source also constrains objectives to 4,000 characters, tracks token/time usage, emits `ThreadGoalUpdated` events, and uses continuation/budget-limit prompts to keep work focused. OMX therefore must not pretend a shell command can mutate hidden Codex thread state. Instead, `owx ultragoal complete-goals` checkpoints repo state and prints an explicit handoff for the active Codex agent to call goal tools safely.

New ultragoal plans default to **aggregate Codex goal mode**: Codex gets one objective for the whole ultragoal run, while OMX owns G001/G002 story state and ledger checkpoints. This avoids the impossible same-thread transition from a completed G001 Codex goal to a new G002 Codex goal. Legacy or explicitly requested **per-story** plans remain supported for users who want one Codex thread per story.

## Artifacts

All artifacts live under `.omx/ultragoal/`:

- `brief.md` — original project/conversation brief.
- `goals.json` — ordered durable plan with status, attempts, evidence, and the active goal id.
- `ledger.jsonl` — append-only checkpoint events (`plan_created`, `goal_started`, `goal_resumed`, `goal_completed`, `goal_blocked`, `goal_failed`, `goal_retried`, `goal_added`, `final_review_failed`, `goal_review_blocked`).

In aggregate mode, `goals.json` also stores:

- `codexGoalMode: "aggregate"`
- `codexObjective` — the exact deterministic objective sent to `create_goal`, capped to Codex's objective limit and referencing `.omx/ultragoal/goals.json`.

## Commands

Create a plan:

```sh
owx ultragoal create-goals --brief "Ship the feature in three safe milestones"
owx ultragoal create-goals --brief-file docs/my-brief.md
cat docs/my-brief.md | owx ultragoal create-goals --from-stdin
owx ultragoal create-goals --codex-goal-mode per-story --brief "Use one fresh Codex thread per story"
```

Start or resume the next goal:

```sh
owx ultragoal complete-goals
```

The command marks the next pending OMX story `in_progress`, appends a ledger entry, and prints a goal-tool handoff. In aggregate mode, the agent should call `get_goal`, then `create_goal` only if no active Codex goal exists. If the same aggregate objective is already active, the agent continues the next OMX story without creating a new Codex goal.

For intermediate stories, do **not** call `update_goal`; checkpoint the OMX story with a fresh `get_goal` snapshot whose objective matches `codexObjective` and whose status is still `active`:

```sh
owx ultragoal checkpoint --goal-id G001-example --status complete --evidence "npm test passed; docs updated" --codex-goal-json ./get-goal.json
```

For the final story, run the whole-run audit plus the mandatory final `ai-slop-cleaner`, post-cleaner verification, and `$code-review` gate. If review is clean (`APPROVE` + `CLEAR`), call `update_goal({status: "complete"})`, call `get_goal` again, and checkpoint with the fresh complete aggregate snapshot plus `--quality-gate-json`. If review is non-clean, do not call `update_goal`; use `owx ultragoal record-review-blockers` to append a durable blocker-resolution story and continue.

Failure handling:

```sh
owx ultragoal checkpoint --goal-id G001-example --status failed --evidence "blocked on missing credential"
owx ultragoal complete-goals --retry-failed
```

Completed legacy thread-goal blocker handling:

```sh
owx ultragoal checkpoint --goal-id G001-example --status blocked --evidence "completed legacy Codex goal blocks create_goal in this thread" --codex-goal-json ./get-goal.json
```

`--status blocked` is a non-terminal ledger checkpoint for legacy per-story or pre-aggregate sessions: a previous, different Codex thread goal is already `complete`, and the current `get_goal`/`create_goal` tool surface has no reset/new-goal operation that can clear that completed goal from the same thread. This writes a `goal_blocked` event, preserves the ultragoal as `in_progress`, and records that the agent must continue the same repo/worktree from a fresh Codex thread where `create_goal` can start the active ultragoal objective.

Status:

```sh
owx ultragoal status
owx ultragoal status --codex-goal-json ./get-goal.json
owx ultragoal status --json
```

## Mandatory final cleanup and review gate

The final ultragoal story is not complete until the active agent has run the final quality gate:

1. Run targeted verification for the story.
2. Run `ai-slop-cleaner` on changed files only; if there are no relevant edits, the cleaner still runs and records a passed/no-op report.
3. Rerun verification after the cleaner pass.
4. Run `$code-review`. Clean means `codeReview.recommendation: "APPROVE"` and `codeReview.architectStatus: "CLEAR"`; `COMMENT`, `WATCH`, `REQUEST CHANGES`, and `BLOCK` are non-clean.
5. If review is non-clean, do **not** call `update_goal`. Record durable blocker work instead:

   ```sh
   owx ultragoal record-review-blockers --goal-id <id> --title "Resolve final code-review blockers" --objective "<blocker-resolution objective>" --evidence "<review findings>" --codex-goal-json <active-get-goal-json-or-path>
   ```

   This marks the current story `review_blocked`, appends a pending blocker-resolution story, keeps the Codex goal active, and lets `owx ultragoal complete-goals` start the blocker next. In legacy per-story mode, the blocker may need a fresh/available Codex goal context because the old per-story Codex goal remains active/incomplete.

6. If review is clean, call `update_goal({status: "complete"})`, call `get_goal`, and checkpoint with a structured final gate:

   ```sh
   owx ultragoal checkpoint --goal-id <id> --status complete --evidence "<tests/files/review evidence>" --codex-goal-json <fresh-complete-get-goal-json-or-path> --quality-gate-json <quality-gate-json-or-path>
   ```

`--quality-gate-json` must include:

```json
{
  "aiSlopCleaner": { "status": "passed", "evidence": "cleaner report" },
  "verification": { "status": "passed", "commands": ["npm test"], "evidence": "post-cleaner verification" },
  "codeReview": { "recommendation": "APPROVE", "architectStatus": "CLEAR", "evidence": "final review synthesis" }
}
```

## Integration constraints

- One Codex thread can have at most one goal focus.
- `create_goal` starts the active objective; it is not a general plan store.
- `update_goal` is completion-only; pause/resume/budget state is controlled by Codex/user/system, not OMX.
- Aggregate mode is the default: one Codex objective covers the whole ultragoal run, and G001/G002 are OMX ledger stories.
- Intermediate aggregate story checkpoints require a matching `active` Codex snapshot. A `complete` snapshot before the final story is rejected to prevent premature `update_goal`. A non-clean final review records the old story as `review_blocked` and appends a pending blocker story before any completion checkpoint.
- Final aggregate story checkpoints require a matching `complete` Codex snapshot captured after `update_goal({status: "complete"})`.
- There is currently no Codex goal-tool reset/new-goal surface for replacing a completed legacy thread goal. In per-story mode, if `get_goal` returns a different completed objective and `create_goal` rejects because the thread already has a goal, record `owx ultragoal checkpoint --status blocked` with that `get_goal` JSON, then continue in a fresh Codex thread on the same branch/worktree and call `create_goal` there for the ultragoal payload.
- Ultragoal owns durable plan and ledger state; Codex goal mode owns active-thread focus and accounting.
- OMX never edits upstream Codex source such as `../../codex`, never shells out to a hidden `/goal` mutator, and never claims that `owx ultragoal checkpoint` changes Codex's active thread goal. The only Codex goal-mode handoff is explicit: `get_goal`, then `create_goal` when no active goal exists, then `update_goal({status: "complete"})` after the real completion audit passes.
- Completion checkpoints require a fresh `get_goal` snapshot. Save or pass the JSON from `get_goal` with `--codex-goal-json <json-or-path>`; OMX compares the objective and enforces the mode-specific status (`active` for intermediate aggregate stories, `complete` for final aggregate or per-story completion).
- Active or incomplete wrong Codex goals remain strict mismatch errors. The `--status blocked` workaround only applies when the blocking Codex snapshot is `complete` and has a different objective from the active ultragoal; it must not be used to bypass active-goal mismatch protection.
- A goal is not complete merely because tests pass or a ledger entry exists. The agent must audit the objective against files, commands, tests, PR state, or other concrete evidence.
